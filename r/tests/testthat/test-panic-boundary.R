# A Rust panic inside a native call reaches R as an error, not an abort.  The
# probe is a test-only entry point compiled with the `test-hooks` feature
# (`pixi run -e r r-install`).  It runs in a child Rscript, so a panic that did
# abort would fail the child rather than kill the test run.
# PG_PHENOTYPE_REQUIRE_TEST_HOOKS=1 (set by `r-test`) turns a missing hook into a
# failure; only installed-tarball checks may skip.
